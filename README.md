*****************************************************
- [Purview API Swagger Reference](https://github.com/Azure/Purview-Samples/blob/master/rest-api/PurviewCatalogAPISwagger.zip)
- Extract ZIP File to a folder of your choice.
- Right-Click on the folder and select "PowerShell > Open Here As Administrator" ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13808986/131237833-6e9837c3-9e7f-4297-a800-2edf690fa9df.png)
- Run "Purview-API-PowerShell.exe"

************
**Benefits**
************
- While you can very well use cURL or Postman to Invoke Azure Purview APIs as well, it is generally cumbersome to extract the Azure OAuth2 *access_token* and use it appropriately in scripts or even during one-time API execution.
- Powershell has very strong and user friendly integration interfaces with Azure Cloud and hence it makes it really useful to have a way to execute Azure Purview service via its APIs on Windows PowerShell.
